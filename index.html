            <h1>Portrait of the Professor as a Young Man</h1>
            <p>
            Several years ago, I told my now-husband that one day, I would draw his picture. 
            It was a hobby of mine a long time ago; mostly I painted famous people I admired, 
            mostly musicians, and occasionally made a self-portrait just for the challenge of 
            it. I was no prodigy, no great talent, but I enjoyed it. Twenty years ago, I was 
            making multiple black and white portraits a year, mostly paintings and the odd 
            drawing on paper. When I finally sat down to make this portrait, it had been years 
            since I had drawn at all. One spring, I had my husband stand by the window in my 
            office so I could get some pictures of him in natural light, the shadows it cast 
            bringing the contours of his face into focus.

            Months later, while he was away on business, I finally put his likeness to paper. 
            I documented the process in case he was curious.
            </p>
            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>
            I decided that charcoal was the way to go. It is a very forgiving medium. Charcoal 
            can provide softness or hard lines depending on how you apply it. It is fairly easy 
            to manipulate, to create a gradient of lightness and darkness, to work and rework 
            until you have the desired effect. My favorite method involves using a toned paper, 
            here a light gray, and first rubbing the whole page with a firm stick of charcoal 
            and then using a soft cloth to blend and even out the whole page, repeating as 
            needed until I have achieved the right tone.
            </p>

            <h2>Drawing With Negative Space</h2>
            A gray kneaded eraser, warmed and smooshed in my hands, shaped into a sort of 
            teardrop shape with a soft point, was the perfect tool to rough in some outlines 
            and features. One of the most interesting aspects of working with charcoal is 
            starting with a black surface and actually drawing in the negative space—the 
            lighter areas—rather than starting with a light page and adding the dark areas 
            as you would with a pen or pencil. There is something almost magical about pulling
             features one by one out of the darkness until they form a recognizable face.
            <!--first pictures of face, eyes (Include caption: While it may look like white chalk on a black surface, here this effect is actually achieved with an eraser, removing material to reveal the gray paper under the charcoal.)-->
               
            <p>Using the eraser to lighten and a stick of charcoal to add black back in as necessary,
               I worked away for three or four hours, giving shape to his face, neck, shoulders, 
               and hair and making small adjustments to the proportions of his features until I was 
               satisfied.</p>

            <h2>Light in the Eyes Makes Him Come Alive</h2>
            <p>
            The next day, after a good sleep, I returned to my work-in-progress with fresh eyes. 
            I had been hesitant to take away too much around his hair, but the ratio of face to 
            hair was off, so I went ahead and cropped it down with the eraser, knowing I could 
            always put it back in later. I used the eraser to shape his shoulders and pull out 
            the contours of his shirt. Once the majority of the portrait was done and no significant 
            adjustments to shape and proportion were anticipated, I began adding highlights to 
            increase the contrast between the darkest and lightest elements of the portrait, giving 
            it depth and bringing it to life. I used a white chalk stick to add bright spots to his
             cheek and forehead, chin, lips, nostrils, and most importantly, eyes. It has always 
             been incredible to me, how a tiny fleck of white can make an eye appear glossy and 
             shiny and the person, alive.

            <h2>The Crown</h2>
            <p>
            Finally, it was time to go back and give my rendering of his hair the attention it deserved. I spent some time standing back from it and using a pencil to compare dimensions on the photo I was working from. When I felt ready, I picked up the charcoal and a soft cloth for blending and started building his afro back up to its proper glory, placing each curl just as it appeared in the picture, to the best of my ability. I struggled a bit not to over-lighten the front portion over the left side of his face, which in the photo is just slightly illuminated by the sunlight, accentuating its shape.

            <h2>Knowing When to Stop</h2>
            <p>
            Throughout a project, there is always a calculation running in the back of my head: if I keep working on this, what are the chances it will be better than it was before? What are the chances I’m just fiddling with details and risking undoing some hard work?
            At the beginning, there is almost no chance it will be worse if I keep going. Rarely am I 100% satisfied with my work, but as I get things closer and closer to where I want them, it’s so important to me to recognize when it’s done and let it be done. After a total of about ten hours, 3-4 times longer than I’d spent on my previous charcoal drawing, I put down my chalk and my charcoal and called it a portrait.
